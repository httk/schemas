# Quasiharmonic thermodynamics (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/thermodynamics/quasiharmonic_thermodynamics`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/thermodynamics/quasiharmonic_thermodynamics.md)**  
**Definition name:** `quasiharmonic_thermodynamics`

**Property name:** Quasiharmonic thermodynamics  
**Description:** Quasiharmonic equilibrium properties as a function of temperature at zero pressure.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

All lists share the dimension `_httk_dim_temperatures`; `temperatures` (K) gives the temperature of each entry.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `equilibrium_volumes` (angstrom^3) is the volume of the whole cell that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy at each temperature.
- `total_helmholtz_free_energies` (eV) INCLUDES the static lattice energy: the minimum over volume V of E_static(V) + F_vib(V, T). It equals the Gibbs energy only at zero pressure, which is the pressure of this property.
- `bulk_moduli` (GPa) is the isothermal bulk modulus B_T obtained from a third-order Birch-Murnaghan fit of F(V, T) at each temperature.
- `volumetric_thermal_expansions` (K^-1) is (1/V_eq) dV_eq/dT, evaluated by second-order finite differences on the supplied temperature grid; endpoint values are one-sided.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](quasiharmonic_thermodynamics.json)] [[MD](quasiharmonic_thermodynamics.md)]

    "description": "Quasiharmonic equilibrium properties as a function of temperature at zero pressure.\n\nAll lists share the dimension `_httk_dim_temperatures`; `temperatures` (K) gives the temperature of each entry.\n\n**Requirements/Conventions**:\n\n- `equilibrium_volumes` (angstrom^3) is the volume of the whole cell that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy at each temperature.\n- `total_helmholtz_free_energies` (eV) INCLUDES the static lattice energy: the minimum over volume V of E_static(V) + F_vib(V, T). It equals the Gibbs energy only at zero pressure, which is the pressure of this property.\n- `bulk_moduli` (GPa) is the isothermal bulk modulus B_T obtained from a third-order Birch-Murnaghan fit of F(V, T) at each temperature.\n- `volumetric_thermal_expansions` (K^-1) is (1/V_eq) dV_eq/dT, evaluated by second-order finite differences on the supplied temperature grid; endpoint values are one-sided.\n\nA null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.",
