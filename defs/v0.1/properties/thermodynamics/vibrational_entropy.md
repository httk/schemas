(1970) defined as \"1 electronvolt is the energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum; 1 eV = 1.60219\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J approximately.\"\nThis definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the value of the elementary charge.\nIn the 2019 redefinition of the SI units the elementary charge is exactly 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) accordingly notes the exact relationship with the SI 2019 derived unit joule as \"1 eV = 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J\" but retains the definition from 1970 in a footnote.\n\nThe unit is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) as \"Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI units\".\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
