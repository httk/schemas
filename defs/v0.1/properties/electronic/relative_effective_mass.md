# Relative effective mass (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/electronic/relative_effective_mass`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/electronic/relative_effective_mass.md)**  
**Definition name:** `relative_effective_mass`

**Property name:** Relative effective mass  
**Description:** The effective-mass tensor of one band at the wavevector `center`, relative to the free-electron mass: m*/m_e = m_e^-1 hbar^2 (d^2E/dk_i dk_j)^-1, the inverse of the band-energy curvature matrix at `center`. `center` is in angstrom^-1 (2 pi included); `tensor` is dimensionless.
The tensor is signed: negative values correspond to hole-like (downward) curvature, and mixed-sign eigenvalues occur at saddle points. Where the curvature matrix is singular the effective mass is undefined and the value is null.
A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.

**Formats:** [[JSON](relative_effective_mass.json)] [[MD](relative_effective_mass.md)]

(1970) categorizes the unit as \"temporarily admitted\" for use with the SI units.\n- The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed.

(2006) changes the categorization to \"Other non-SI units\" and adds as a clarifying footnote \"The \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is widely used by x-ray crystallographers and structural chemists because all chemical bonds lie in the range 1 to 3 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms. However it has no official sanction from the CIPM or the CGPM.\"\n- The \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is omitted in the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition (2019).\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
