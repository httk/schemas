# Spin-channel electronic density of states (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/electronic/spin_channel_electronic_density_of_states`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/electronic/spin_channel_electronic_density_of_states.md)**  
**Definition name:** `spin_channel_electronic_density_of_states`

**Property name:** Spin-channel electronic density of states  
**Description:** Electronic density of states of a simulation cell in one collinear spin channel.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

All lists share the dimension `_httk_dim_energies`; `energies` gives the energy of each entry. Non-collinear calculations are out of scope; see `electronic_density_of_states` for the spin-summed density.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `spin` is the spin channel: `up` or `down`.
- `energies` (eV) are on the absolute energy scale of the calculation.
- `density` (eV^-1) is the number of electronic states per eV per simulation cell in this one spin channel.
- `integrated_density` (dimensionless) is the number of states of this channel per cell integrated from the lowest energy.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](spin_channel_electronic_density_of_states.json)] [[MD](spin_channel_electronic_density_of_states.md)]

(1970) defined as \"1 electronvolt is the energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum; 1 eV = 1.60219\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J approximately.\"\nThis definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the value of the elementary charge.\nIn the 2019 redefinition of the SI units the elementary charge is exactly 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) accordingly notes the exact relationship with the SI 2019 derived unit joule as \"1 eV = 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J\" but retains the definition from 1970 in a footnote.\n\nThe unit is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) as \"Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI units\".\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
