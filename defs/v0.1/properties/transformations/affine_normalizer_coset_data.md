# Affine normalizer coset data (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/affine_normalizer_coset_data`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/affine_normalizer_coset_data.md)**  
**Definition name:** `affine_normalizer_coset_data`

**Property name:** Affine normalizer coset data  
**Description:** Ordered table of bounded affine normalizer coset-representative data for crystallographic space groups, with one item for each Hall setting.  
**Type:** list  

The affine normalizer of a space group describes affine mappings that send the space group to itself.
In practical algorithms this information is useful after a candidate space-group setting has been identified, because additional normalizer representatives can be applied to explore equivalent descriptions, equivalent origin choices, or equivalent embeddings without changing the underlying space group.
The representatives are listed modulo the space group itself, so each listed operation represents an equivalence class of normalizer operations rather than every operation in that class.

The `orthogonal_affine_normalizer_cosets` list is the signed-permutation subset of representatives.
The `affine_normalizer_cosets` list is generated from a bounded set of unimodular integer linear parts and may include non-orthogonal representatives.
Both lists are finite bounded tables and MUST NOT be interpreted as complete infinite affine normalizers.
Each listed representative carries `compatible_systems`, which states the crystal metric systems for which the representative preserves the metric constraints.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- It MUST be a list of dictionaries.
- The list order MUST match the generator's Hall-setting order.
- The companion top-level `indicies.hall_symbol_to_affine_normalizer_coset_data` lookup maps normalized Hall entries to zero-based positions in this list; it is not an OPTIMADE property.
- Each dictionary MUST contain a `hall_entry` value equal to the Hall-entry key used by the companion index.
- Count fields MUST equal the length of their corresponding representative lists.
- Matrix and vector entries inside representatives MUST be exact strings, using integer strings or fraction strings as appropriate.
- The `candidate_sets` dictionary records generation bookkeeping for the finite candidate searches and is not itself a crystallographic normalizer object.
