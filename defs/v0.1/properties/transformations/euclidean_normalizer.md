# Euclidean normalizer (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/euclidean_normalizer`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/euclidean_normalizer.md)**  
**Definition name:** `euclidean_normalizer`

**Property name:** Euclidean normalizer  
**Description:** Finite Euclidean normalizer operations for one crystallographic space-group setting.  
**Type:** dictionary  

The Euclidean normalizer consists of metric-preserving affine operations that normalize the space group in the chosen setting.
These operations are useful for algorithms that need to compare or enumerate equivalent descriptions of the same setting under rigid crystallographic changes of coordinates.

This object is generated from the finite Euclidean normalizer operations exposed by cctbx.
It is not a bounded candidate search table.
Therefore fields such as `candidate_set`, `candidate_sets`, and bounded-search `bounds` do not belong to this property.

This property is one of three related normalizer tables for a setting:
this property holds the finite Euclidean normalizer operations obtained from cctbx,
`orthogonal_affine_normalizer` holds the older bounded coset table restricted to signed-permutation linear parts,
and `affine_normalizer` holds the bounded coset table generated from unimodular integer linear parts.
Continuous origin-shift freedoms are described separately by `continuous_normalizer`.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- It MUST be a dictionary with the following keys:

    - **normalizer\_kind**: REQUIRED; String.
      Kind label for this normalizer contribution.
      For this property the value is `euclidean`.

    - **n\_centering\_translations**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      Number of centering translations represented in the underlying Euclidean normalizer operation construction.

    - **n\_pointgroup\_symops**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      Number of point-group symmetry operations represented before centering translations are combined with them.

    - **n\_symops**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      Number of Euclidean normalizer operations listed in `symops`.
      This value MUST equal the length of `symops`.

    - **n\_linear\_parts**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      Number of distinct linear matrix parts represented in `symops`.

    - **symops**: REQUIRED; List of dictionaries.
      Finite Euclidean normalizer operations for the setting.
      Each item follows `/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/op`.

    - **symops\_mod\_centering**: REQUIRED; List of dictionaries.
      Euclidean normalizer operations factorized modulo the centering translations of the setting.
      This keeps one operation for each linear part and translation class modulo centering, while `symops` keeps the complete operation list.
      Each item follows `/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/op`.
