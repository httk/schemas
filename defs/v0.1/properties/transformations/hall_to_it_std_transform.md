# Hall to IT standard transform (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/hall_to_it_std_transform`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transformations/hall_to_it_std_transform.md)**  
**Definition name:** `hall_to_it_std_transform`

**Property name:** Hall to IT standard transform  
**Description:** Exact basis and origin transform from one stored Hall setting to the International Tables standard Hall setting of the same space-group type.  
**Type:** dictionary  

This transform is useful when data generated or detected in an arbitrary Hall setting needs to be compared with a conventional IT-standard reference setting.
The transform is represented by `matrix` and `vector`, following the same affine-transformation convention as the other generated transformation tables.

If `x_to_ref_hall` is a fractional coordinate column vector in the target IT-standard Hall setting, and `x_from_hall` is the corresponding fractional coordinate column vector in the source Hall setting keyed by the containing map, then the stored transform satisfies:
`x_from_hall = matrix * x_to_ref_hall + vector`.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- It MUST be a dictionary describing one exact transform from the containing Hall setting to the IT-standard Hall setting of the same `it_number`.
- The `index` value is always `1`, because this is a same-space-group setting transform rather than a proper subgroup transform.
- Matrix and vector entries MUST be exact strings, using integer strings or fraction strings as appropriate.
- It MUST be a dictionary with the following keys:

    - **hall\_entry**: REQUIRED; String.
      Source Hall-entry key for the setting transformed by this object.

    - **it\_number**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      International Tables space-group number shared by the source and target Hall settings.

    - **to\_hall\_entry**: REQUIRED; String.
      Target Hall-entry key for the IT-standard Hall setting of the same space-group type.

    - **index**: REQUIRED; Integer.
      Transform index.
      For this table the value is `1` because the transform maps between settings of the same space group.

    - **affine\_transformation**: REQUIRED; Dictionary.
      Exact affine map for this setting transform.
      It MUST follow `/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/affine_transformation`.
      The transform convention is `x_from_hall = matrix * x_to_ref_hall + vector`, where `matrix` and `vector` are the fields inside `affine_transformation`.

**Examples:**

- `{"hall_entry": "p_1", "it_number": 1, "to_hall_entry": "p_1", "index": 1, "affine_transformation": {"matrix": [["1", "0", "0"], ["0", "1", "0"], ["0", "0", "1"]], "vector": ["0", "0", "0"]}}`

**Formats:** [[JSON](hall_to_it_std_transform.json)] [[MD](hall_to_it_std_transform.md)]
