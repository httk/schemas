# Operation xyz (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/op_xyz`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/op_xyz.md)**  
**Definition name:** `op_xyz`

**Property name:** Operation xyz  
**Description:** Coordinate operation expressed in the algebraic xyz form, also known as Jones' faithful representation (Bradley & Cracknell, 1972: pp. 35-37; adapted for computer strings).  
**Type:** string  

The following definition is adapted from (and meant to be compatible with) the IUCr symCIF version 1.0.1 dictionary definition of `_space_group_symop.operation_xyz` referenced to: International Tables for Crystallography (2002). Volume A, Space-group symmetry, edited by Th. Hahn, 5th. ed. (Kluwer Academic Publishers).
It is available at: https://www.iucr.org/__data/iucr/cifdic_html/2/cif_sym.dic/Ispace_group_symop.operation_xyz.html

If W is a matrix representation of the rotational part of the symmetry operation defined by the positions and signs of x, y and z, and w is a column of translations defined by the fractions, an equivalent position X' is generated from a given position X by the equation: X' = WX + w.

**Examples:**

- `"-x,-y,z"`
- `"x,1/2-y,1/2+z"`

**Formats:** [[JSON](op_xyz.json)] [[MD](op_xyz.md)]
