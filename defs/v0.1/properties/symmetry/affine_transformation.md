# Affine transformation (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/affine_transformation`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/symmetry/affine_transformation.md)**  
**Definition name:** `affine_transformation`

**Property name:** Affine transformation  
**Description:** An affine transformation acting on fractional crystallographic coordinates.  
**Type:** dictionary  

An invertible affine transformation preserves collinearity and parallelism, but need not preserve Euclidean distances or angles.
A singular affine map can collapse a line or plane to a lower-dimensional image.
The transformation is represented by a 3 by 3 matrix and a 3-vector, both serialized with exact string entries.
With column vectors, the map is `u_out = matrix * u_in + vector`; matrix rows specify the three output components.
The containing property identifies whether `u_in` denotes fractional coordinates or abstract Wyckoff parameters and identifies the input and output settings.
No wrapping modulo lattice translations is implicit in this equation; apply any required periodic reduction only in the specified output setting.
The transformation may, for example, represent an operation within one setting, a setting transform, a subgroup embedding, a normalizer representative, or a parametric coordinate map for a Wyckoff-position orbit representative.
When used as a parametric coordinate map, the matrix may be singular because special Wyckoff positions can constrain or identify parameters.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- It MUST be a dictionary with the following keys:

    - **matrix**: REQUIRED; Exact 3x3 matrix.
      Matrix part of the affine transformation.
      It MUST be represented as a list of three row lists, each containing three exact rational entries represented as strings.

    - **vector**: REQUIRED; List of 3 Fractions (String).
      Translation or origin-shift vector of the affine transformation in fractional coordinates.

    - **xyz**: OPTIONAL; String.
      Coordinate expression for the affine transformation in `x,y,z` notation when available.
      It MUST express the same affine map as `matrix` and `vector`, using `x,y,z` for the input components.

    - **det**: OPTIONAL; Integer.
      Determinant of `matrix` when the generator emits it.

    - **is\_orthogonal**: OPTIONAL; Boolean.
      Whether the linear part preserves the crystallographic metric family specified by the containing setting; this is not a test of the fractional matrix against the Cartesian identity metric.

**Examples:**

- `{"matrix": [["-1", "0", "0"], ["0", "-1", "0"], ["0", "0", "1"]], "vector": ["0", "0", "0"], "xyz": "-x,-y,z", "det": 1, "is_orthogonal": true}`

**Formats:** [[JSON](affine_transformation.json)] [[MD](affine_transformation.md)]
