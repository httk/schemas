# Elastic tensor (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/mechanics/elastic_tensor`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/mechanics/elastic_tensor.md)**  
**Definition name:** `elastic_tensor`

**Property name:** Elastic tensor  
**Description:** The 6x6 elastic stiffness tensor C in Voigt notation, in gigapascal; symmetric. Rows and columns follow Voigt order [xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy]. Elastic stiffness relates tensor stress to ENGINEERING shear strain (gamma = 2 epsilon), so that sigma_i = C_ij e_j in Voigt form; compliance S = C^-1 in the same convention (S includes the factors 2 and 4 for shear components relative to the tensor compliance).
At finite pressure this is the stress-strain coefficient tensor (Wallace's B), and stability tests on it use positive definiteness directly.
A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.  
**Type:** list  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** MUST be a queryable property with support for all mandatory filter features.  



**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](elastic_tensor.json)] [[MD](elastic_tensor.md)]
