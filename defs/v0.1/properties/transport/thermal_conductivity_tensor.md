# Thermal conductivity tensor (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/thermal_conductivity_tensor`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/thermal_conductivity_tensor.md)**  
**Definition name:** `thermal_conductivity_tensor`

**Property name:** Thermal conductivity tensor  
**Description:** The thermal conductivity tensor kappa_ij, in watt per metre per kelvin (W m^-1 K^-1), a 3x3 Cartesian tensor with both indices over `dim_spatial` in the Cartesian frame of the referenced cell.
Obtained from Green-Kubo or Einstein relations. By the Green-Kubo relation kappa_ij = 1 / (V kB T^2) times the time integral of <J_i(0) J_j(t)>, where J is the extensive heat current. The tensor is not assumed to be symmetric.
A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.  
**Type:** list  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** MUST be a queryable property with support for all mandatory filter features.  



**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](thermal_conductivity_tensor.json)] [[MD](thermal_conductivity_tensor.md)]
