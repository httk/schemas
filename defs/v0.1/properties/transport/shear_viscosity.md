# Shear viscosity (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/shear_viscosity`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/shear_viscosity.md)**  
**Definition name:** `shear_viscosity`

**Property name:** Shear viscosity  
**Description:** The shear viscosity, in pascal second (Pa s).
Obtained from Green-Kubo or Einstein relations. By the Green-Kubo relation eta = V / (kB T) times the time integral of <sigma_xy(0) sigma_xy(t)>, averaged over the independent off-diagonal stress components.
A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.  
**Type:** float  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** MUST be a queryable property with support for all mandatory filter features.  



**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](shear_viscosity.json)] [[MD](shear_viscosity.md)]
