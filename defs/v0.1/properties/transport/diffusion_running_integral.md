# Diffusion running integral (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/diffusion_running_integral`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/transport/diffusion_running_integral.md)**  
**Definition name:** `diffusion_running_integral`

**Property name:** Diffusion running integral  
**Description:** Running integral of the velocity autocorrelation tensor, as a function of upper integration limit.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

All lists of the dictionary share the dimension `_httk_dim_lags`; `lag_times` gives the lag time of each entry. 

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `diffusion_tensors` (m^2 s^-1) is the trapezoidal running integral of the velocity autocorrelation tensor from 0 to each lag time. Each tensor member has the shared lag dimension first, followed by two `dim_spatial` axes (Cartesian x, y, z) giving the tensor components; the tensor is not symmetrized.
- Selection of a plateau value, giving the diffusion tensor, is left to the user.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](diffusion_running_integral.json)] [[MD](diffusion_running_integral.md)]
