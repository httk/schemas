# Steinhardt bond order (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/structure/steinhardt_bond_order`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/structure/steinhardt_bond_order.md)**  
**Definition name:** `steinhardt_bond_order`

**Property name:** Steinhardt bond order  
**Description:** Steinhardt bond-orientational order of a set of atoms, from spherical harmonics Y_lm of the directions of directed neighbour bonds within a cutoff. No neighbour-of-neighbour averaging and no crystalline/liquid classification is implied.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `degree` (integer) is the harmonic degree l.
- `cutoff` (angstrom) is the neighbour cutoff, inclusive.
- `global_order` (dimensionless, null when there are no bonds) is the bond-weighted Q_l = sqrt(4 pi / (2 l + 1) * sum_m abs(<Y_lm>_bonds)^2), pooling all directed bonds (each pair contributes both r and -r); it is identically zero (to rounding) for odd l.
- `local_orders` (dimensionless, dimension `_httk_dim_atoms`) is the per-atom q_l, null for an atom without neighbours.
- `coordination_numbers` (dimensionless integers, dimension `_httk_dim_atoms`) is the number of neighbour bonds per atom.
- Atoms are in the order of the analysed positions.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

(1970) categorizes the unit as \"temporarily admitted\" for use with the SI units.\n- The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorization to \"Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System.\"\n- The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) changes the categorization to \"Other non-SI units\" and adds as a clarifying footnote \"The \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is widely used by x-ray crystallographers and structural chemists because all chemical bonds lie in the range 1 to 3 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms. However it has no official sanction from the CIPM or the CGPM.\"\n- The \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is omitted in the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition (2019).\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
