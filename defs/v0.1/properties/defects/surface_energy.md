# Surface energy (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/defects/surface_energy`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/defects/surface_energy.md)**  
**Definition name:** `surface_energy`

**Property name:** Surface energy  
**Description:** The surface energy gamma = (E_slab - N E_bulk - sum_i dn_i mu_i) / A_total, in joule per square metre (J m^-2), with E_bulk the bulk energy per formula-unit-or-atom counted by N, dn_i the excess number of atoms of species i and mu_i their chemical potentials.
A_total is the total exposed area: both faces of a symmetric slab are counted.
A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.  
**Type:** float  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** MUST be a queryable property with support for all mandatory filter features.  



**Examples:**



**Formats:** [[JSON](surface_energy.json)] [[MD](surface_energy.md)]
