# NVE energy drift (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/validation/nve_energy_drift`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/validation/nve_energy_drift.md)**  
**Definition name:** `nve_energy_drift`

**Property name:** NVE energy drift  
**Description:** Linear drift of the conserved total energy (kinetic plus potential) per atom along a selected interval of a trajectory in the NVE ensemble.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

Total energies are divided by the number of atoms before the fit; a straight line is fitted by least squares against time over all selected samples.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `slope` (eV per atom per ps, unit `eV*ps^-1`) is the fitted slope.
- `intercept` (eV per atom) is the fitted energy at `start`.
- `residual_rms` (eV per atom) is the root mean square of the fit residuals over all samples, of the per-atom energies.
- `endpoint_change` (eV per atom) is the observed energy at the last sample minus that at the first.
- `start` and `stop` (ps) are the first and last sample times.
- `samples` is the number of samples (at least three).

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

(1970) defined as \"1 electronvolt is the energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum; 1 eV = 1.60219\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J approximately.\"\nThis definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the value of the elementary charge.\nIn the 2019 redefinition of the SI units the elementary charge is exactly 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) accordingly notes the exact relationship with the SI 2019 derived unit joule as \"1 eV = 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J\" but retains the definition from 1970 in a footnote.\n\nThe unit is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) as \"Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI units\".\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
