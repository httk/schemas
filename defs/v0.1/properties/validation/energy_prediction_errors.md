# Energy prediction errors (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/validation/energy_prediction_errors`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/validation/energy_prediction_errors.md)**  
**Definition name:** `energy_prediction_errors`

**Property name:** Energy prediction errors  
**Description:** Per-atom total-energy prediction errors of a model against reference energies over a set of configurations.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

All errors are predicted minus reference, per atom, in eV, after subtracting `offset_per_atom` from every predicted per-atom energy when it is not null. `residuals` has the dimension `_httk_dim_configurations`, one entry per configuration in input order.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `weighting` is `configuration` (every configuration weighted equally) or `atom` (every atom weighted equally, i.e. configurations weighted by atom count). It applies to `bias`, `mae` and `rmse`.
- `offset_per_atom` (eV per atom) is the explicit offset that was subtracted from the predicted energies; null means a raw comparison, no offset was applied and none is inferred from the data.
- `count` is the number of configurations.
- `bias`, `mae` and `rmse` (eV per atom) are the weighted mean signed residual, weighted mean absolute residual and weighted root mean square residual.
- `maximum_absolute_error` and `percentile95_absolute_error` (eV per atom) are the largest absolute residual and the 95th percentile absolute residual (linear interpolation); both are unweighted under every weighting.
- For the natural population (`weighting` configuration, `offset_per_atom` null) `bias`, `mae`, `rmse` and `maximum_absolute_error` equal the derivation records of `total_energy_per_atom`.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

(1970) defined as \"1 electronvolt is the energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum; 1 eV = 1.60219\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J approximately.\"\nThis definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the value of the elementary charge.\nIn the 2019 redefinition of the SI units the elementary charge is exactly 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) accordingly notes the exact relationship with the SI 2019 derived unit joule as \"1 eV = 1.602176634\u00b710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J\" but retains the definition from 1970 in a footnote.\n\nThe unit is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) as \"Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI units\".\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
