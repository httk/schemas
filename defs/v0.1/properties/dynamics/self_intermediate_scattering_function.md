# Self intermediate scattering function (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/self_intermediate_scattering_function`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/self_intermediate_scattering_function.md)**  
**Definition name:** `self_intermediate_scattering_function`

**Property name:** Self intermediate scattering function  
**Description:** Self intermediate scattering function F_s(q,t) = mean over atoms and time origins t0 of exp(i q . [r(t0 + t) - r(t0)]), with q the Cartesian wavevector (2 pi included) and r the unwrapped position of an atom; F_s(q,0) = 1.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

All lists share the dimensions named below; the same `_httk_dim_lags` and `_httk_dim_wavevectors` lengths apply in every member that uses them.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `lag_times` (ps, dimension `_httk_dim_lags`) are the lag times.
- `wavevectors` (angstrom^-1, Cartesian, 2 pi included) is a list over `_httk_dim_wavevectors` of vectors over `dim_spatial` (x, y, z).
- `real` and `imaginary` (dimensionless) are the real and imaginary parts of the function: lists over `_httk_dim_lags` of lists over `_httk_dim_wavevectors`.
- `origin_counts` (optional, dimensionless integers, dimension `_httk_dim_lags`) gives the number of time origins averaged for each lag.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.

**Examples:**
