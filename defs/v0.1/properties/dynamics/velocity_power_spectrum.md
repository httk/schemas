# Velocity power spectrum (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/velocity_power_spectrum`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/velocity_power_spectrum.md)**  
**Definition name:** `velocity_power_spectrum`

**Property name:** Velocity power spectrum  
**Description:** Velocity power spectrum of a trajectory: a one-sided periodogram of the atomic velocities, not a normalized phonon density of states.  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `frequencies` (THz, ordinary frequency, dimension `_httk_dim_frequencies`) are the frequencies of the discrete Fourier transform.
- `power` (angstrom^2*ps^-1, i.e. (angstrom/ps)^2 per THz, dimension `_httk_dim_frequencies`) is averaged equally over atoms and Cartesian components. It is one-sided: every bin except the zero-frequency bin (and the Nyquist bin for an even number of frames) is doubled. It is normalized so that the sum of power times the frequency spacing equals the window-weighted mean square velocity.
- `window` is the window applied to each velocity series before the transform: `none` (rectangular) or `hann`.
- `mean_removed` states whether the time mean of each atom and Cartesian component was subtracted before windowing.
- `mean_square` (optional, angstrom^2*ps^-2) is the window-weighted mean square velocity.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.
