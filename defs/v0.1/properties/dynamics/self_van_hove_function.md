# Self van Hove function (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/self_van_hove_function`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/dynamics/self_van_hove_function.md)**  
**Definition name:** `self_van_hove_function`

**Property name:** Self van Hove function  
**Description:** Self van Hove function G_s(r,t) at one lag: the probability density per volume of the displacement of a single atom over the lag, binned in the displacement length r (spherical shells).  
**Type:** dictionary  
**Implementation requirements:**  
- **Support:** OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.  

- **Query:** Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.  

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- `lag_time` (ps) is the lag.
- `bin_edges` (angstrom, dimension `_httk_dim_radial_bin_edges`) are the shell edges; its length is the number of bins plus one.
- `density` (angstrom^-3, dimension `_httk_dim_radial_bins`) is counts / (samples * (4 pi / 3) * (r_hi^3 - r_lo^3)) for each shell between consecutive edges; it integrates to 1 over all space, and a finite radial range is not renormalized.
- `samples` (optional, integer) is the number of atom-origin samples, the number of displacement vectors histogrammed.
- `counts` (optional, dimensionless integers, dimension `_httk_dim_radial_bins`) are the raw histogram counts per shell.

A null value means the quantity is not available or not recorded.
