# Centering translations (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/spacegroups/centering_translations`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/spacegroups/centering_translations.md)**  
**Definition name:** `centering_translations`

**Property name:** Centering translations  
**Description:** Centering translations of the conventional cell.  
**Type:** list  

Each list member is one exact fractional-coordinate centering translation as defined by `/properties/symmetry/centering_translation`.
The zero translation `(0,0,0)` is listed first.

**Examples:**

- `[["0", "0", "0"]]`
- `[["0", "0", "0"], ["1/2", "1/2", "0"]]`

**Formats:** [[JSON](centering_translations.json)] [[MD](centering_translations.md)]
