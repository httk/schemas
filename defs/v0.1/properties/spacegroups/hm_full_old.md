# Full Hermann-Mauguin symbol in old notation (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/spacegroups/hm_full_old`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/properties/spacegroups/hm_full_old.md)**  
**Definition name:** `hm_full_old`

**Property name:** Full Hermann-Mauguin symbol in old notation  
**Description:** The older full Hermann-Mauguin symbol retained as an alias for symbols superseded by newer `e`-glide notation.  
**Type:** string  

Hermann-Mauguin symbols describe crystallographic space groups using lattice-centering symbols and symmetry-element symbols. The setting-specific fields describe the concrete Hall/International Tables setting of the current record. The `*_std` fields describe the IT-standard setting for the space-group type and can therefore be identical across multiple settings with the same IT number.

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- The plain string form uses spaces between symbol parts where this is needed for unambiguous parsing.
- Older-symbol fields are present only where an older International Tables form is retained for comparison or aliasing.

**Examples:**

- `"A b m 2"`
- `"C 2 m b"`

**Formats:** [[JSON](hm_full_old.json)] [[MD](hm_full_old.md)]
