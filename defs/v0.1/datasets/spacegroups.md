# Space groups (property)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Property Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/datasets/spacegroups`](https://schemas.httk.org/defs/v0.1/datasets/spacegroups.md)**  
**Definition name:** `spacegroups`

**Property name:** Space groups  
**Description:** Ordered table of crystallographic space-group setting records.
Each item describes one concrete Hall/International Tables setting of a space group, including symbols, classifications, symmetry operations, asymmetric-unit information, Wyckoff positions, and related auxiliary data.
The companion top-level `indicies.index_hall_entry_to_spacegroups` lookup maps normalized Hall entries to indices in this list; it is not an OPTIMADE property.  
**Type:** list  

**Requirements/Conventions**:

- Items MUST be ordered in the same setting order as `spacegroup_symbols.json.gz`, with additional cctbx-only Hall settings kept in their IT-number block.
- A single IT number can occur in several items.
- The `setting_it_nc` property gives the corresponding International Tables `n:c` setting code when applicable.

**Examples:**

- `[{"setting_it_nc": "5:b1", "it_number": 5, "hall_entry": "c_2y"}]`

**Formats:** [[JSON](spacegroups.json)] [[MD](spacegroups.md)]
